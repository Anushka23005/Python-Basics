It does not take any automatic first argument, so it has no access to either the instance (self) or the class (cls). Because of this, it cannot read or modify class or instance attributes. Static methods are mainly used for utility or helper functions that are logically related to the class but do not depend on any class-specific or object-specific data.\n",
        "\n",
        "- A class method, on the other hand, is defined using the @classmethod decorator and takes the class itself as the first argument, conventionally named cls. This allows it to access and modify class-level attributes and even create new instances of the class. Class methods are commonly used for factory methods or for operations that need to work with the class as a whole rather than with a particular instance."
